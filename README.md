# DemoUp Coding Challenge

**Your mission:**
First read this file completely!!! 

Second, write a simple website, which fetches product information out of a MySQL database, presents it to the user and makes it possible to change the product name.

The database dump can be found on git, be aware that an unconcentrated intern might have added some syntactic mistakes. 

The site itself should make use of the Bootstrap framework and use it for a table, filled with all products(name, model number, international content). Each row of this table consists only of one product. Model numbers and international fields should be concatenated as shown below:


|ID|Name|I18N Name|Model Number|
|---|---|---|---|
|394|NULL|Water Smart Flow Meter,Wassermengenzähler,Průtokoměr,Vandmængdetæller,Nutikas voolumõõdik,计流器,wassermeter|8188,8188-20,8188-24,8188-29|

We do not expect the perfect and complete solution. Moreover we evaluate the progress you made, the things you added, the structure created, the comments you made.
